# Job Market Data Analysis

### üìù Project Description

According to Jobscan, 99% of Fortune 500 companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) as their recruitment strategy.
All ATS' store candidates' information by using keywords, so it's easy to parse and filter them.
If applicant's resume does not meet certain criteria, it is either flagged or auto-rejected.
"Beat the ATS" Project aims to analyse the most popular tools and skills (keywords) for Data Analytics field and check if there is a relationship between those skills, education and earnings.

### ‚ùî Hypotheses:
1. There are certain technologies that are more sought after than others.
2. There are certain tools that are more sought after than others.
3. There are certain soft skills that are sought after by employers.
4. There is a correlation between education level and earnings.
5. There is a correlation between experience level (measured in years) and earnings.


### üí° Findings:
1. The analysis has confirmed all five hypotheses.
2. There are certain technologies that are more sought after than others: the most sought after language for Data Analytics is SQL, the second is Python, the third is SAS.
3. There are certain tools that are more sought after than others: the most sought after tool is Tableau and then Power BI.
4. There are certain soft skills that are sought after by employers: the most sought after soft skills are: Communication, ability to work in agile as well as problem-solving skills (in this order).
5. There is a correlation between education level and earnings: the higher education, the higher average pay. Findings for High School and 'Some College' qualification result can be inaccurate as there was not enough data, therefore they are not included in findings. Therefore, the data for that may not reflect reality, but it could potentially give a rough idea of how it may be.
6. San Francisco Bay, New York and Seattle areas' average salary is higher than in other areas (showed on heat maps).
7. There is a correlation between experience level (measured in years) and earnings: as years of experience increase, the annual salary increases proportionally.
