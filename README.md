# Job Market Data Analysis

### Summary

###### According to Jobscan, 99% of Fortune 500 companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) as their recruitment strategy.
###### All ATS' store candidates' information by using keywords, so it's easy to parse and filter them.
###### If applicant's resume does not meet certain criteria, it is either flagged or auto-rejected.
###### "Beat the ATS" Project aims to analyse the most popular tools and skills (keywords) for Data Analytics field and check if there is a relationship between those skills and earnings.

<b>All research questions are based on years 2020-2021 in the United States of America</b>

###### 5. There is a correlation between education level and earnings: the average Bachelor with 5 years of experience is paid 139,118 thousand dollars, the average master’s holder with 5 years of experience is paid 176,000 thousand dollars. The average PhD holder with 5 years of experience is paid 268,555 thousand dollars. Findings for  High School and 'Some College' qualification result can be inaccurate as there was not enough data. Therefore, the data for that may not reflect reality, but it could potentially give a rough idea of how it may be.
